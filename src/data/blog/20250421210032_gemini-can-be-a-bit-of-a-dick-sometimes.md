Me: what now?



Show thinking
Okay, "what now?" depends entirely on the results of those two follow-up checks from my previous message:

The tail check on the manually extracted v4.1.4's package.json: Did this confirm the bin field was truly missing from the end of the file?
The manual download/extract test for v3.4.3: Did this succeed, and did its package.json contain the bin field?
We need those two pieces of information to decide the next logical step:

If v4.1.4 is definitely missing bin BUT v3.4.3 extracts correctly with bin: The problem is specific to the v4.1.4 package being served. The "what now?" would be to use v3.4.3 (or another working version) via npm install tailwindcss@3.4.3 and potentially report the issue with v4.1.4 to npm/Tailwind.
If both v4.1.4 AND v3.4.3 extract without the bin field (even manually with tar): The problem is almost certainly with your system's extraction process (tar/zlib libraries) or consistent network corruption. The "what now?" would be to investigate system library health, network proxies, or potentially run filesystem checks (fsck).
So, the immediate "what now?" is to please run those two checks (the tail verification and the v3.4.3 manual download/extract) and let me know the results. That will dictate our next move.
