# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my first blog post! This is an example of how to write posts using Astro Paper.

## How to Create Posts

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `src/data/blog/` directory.
2. Add the required front matter at the top of the file.
3. Write your content in Markdown format.

### Front Matter Requirements

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "A brief description of your post"
pubDatetime: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
draft: false
---
```

## Markdown Features

You can use all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold text** for emphasis.
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis.
- Lists (like this one).
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting.

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

## Adding Images

You can add images using standard Markdown syntax:

![Pig](/images/pig.jpg)

## Adding Links
