Arrrgggh! I've done it wrong.

&#x1F4AC; Tina: Arrrgggh! I've done it wrong.


I should have talked to people instead of building in a vacuum.

The closer I get to needing to show someone, the dumber and more pointless my idea feels.

So what does it solve, and for who?

1. For insurance claims. Users, both claiments and inspection staff can photograph or video or add a file. System registers when content was added and ties it back to the device, Time and location. Images can be permanently tagged and referenced back to register. 

No! That's what it does. Not who can use it.

2. Content creators. Register public content they create. Later verify content hasn't changed since creation.

3. Law enforcement.  Crime scene chain of custody for digital media.  Tag and route files. Verify they haven't changed. 

4. Shipping/delivery. Sender can register image or file content.  Eg photographs of a shipment before it leaves. Recipient can visually check it looks same when it arrives.
