title: "Processing flow"
description: "This blog post discusses a smooth processing flow for handling files in a web application. The process involves a file being selected on the front end site, a submit request sent to a Lambda function with metadata in a JSON payload, validation of the metadata by Lambda, obtaining a presigned URL from S3, returning the URL to the client, direct file upload to S3 by the client, triggering an SQS queue event by S3, and finally, the Lambda function processing the file pulled from S3 along with additional logic. The post provides a detailed step-by-step guide on how this processing flow works seamlessly."

Nice processing flow 

1. File selected on front end site
2. Front end sends a submit request to a lambda function with a json payload full of metadata 
3. Lambda does some validation on the metadata. If ok, hits s3 and requests a presigned url 
4. Lambda returns the presigned url to the client 
5. Client pushes File directly to s3 (not to web server)
6. File lands on s3
7. S3 triggers a sqs queue event
8. Lambda processing flow is triggered from sqs message 
9. Lambda function pulls File from s3 and processes it (including a bunch of other logic)
