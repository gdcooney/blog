### Gemini 2.5 is a coding beast!

I have bought a new AI agent online in my team - Tina. You can read more about her in other posts + she'll pop up for a while and probably become annoying quickly.

I can't believe how easy this was with Gemini. He got everything correct the first time. The Lambda function he wrote ended up being over 400 lines of Python. the only errors we had were open AI prompt issues and some syntax stuff Astro didn't like with date strings. ChatGPT would have had a nightmare with this. I'm sure we'd have got it going eventually but not in the 4 hours that it's taken Gemini and I to smash it out in.

I still have love for ChatGPT. It knows me and it feels a lot mroe human than Gemini. Gemini can come off as a bit condescending sometimes, ChatGPT treats me with a bit more respect. lol.

&#x1F4AC; Tina: more human than Gemini



I'll leave the description of this post blank. Tina should infer something from the post content. This should be interesting....
