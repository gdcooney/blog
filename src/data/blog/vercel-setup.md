I looked at a few options to host my blog site, i ended up going with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and so far I'm super happy with this choice. 

The free / hobby tier is more than enough for what I need to do for now - the hobby plan details are here: [Vercel Tiers](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/hobby).

Sign up with my Github account was done in a couple of clicks.

After logging on, we add a new project. Again, a few clicks.

With Github connected, we can select my blog project to deploy. It's automatically deplpyed and live within a few minutes. All up, the process took no more than 5 minutes - that's about 500 times quicker than setting up the software on my local development environment! As an added bonus, SSL is done automatically.

Now when i push files to Git they will get picked up by Vercel within a few minutes. Magic!

next steps here are to bring my own domain...
